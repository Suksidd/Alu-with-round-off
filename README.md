A math coprocessor, often known as a floating-point unit (FPU), is a component of a computer system that is specifically intended to perform operations on floating-point numbers. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are common operations handled by FPU. 

Handling Floating Point data, converting data to IEEE754 format, and executing any of the arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are all accomplished. All of the methods listed above have been tested in the Vivado environment. 

All of the functions are created using efficient methods, with a few tweaks made at our end when the scope allowed. As a result, each unit function is distinct in certain ways, but in the proper context, these functions will likely to be equivalent in terms of efficiency and speed, and if pipelined, better throughput.
